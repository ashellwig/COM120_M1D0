    \subsection{Ashton Scott Hellwig's Personal Introduction}
      Hello, everyone! My name is Ashton Scott Hellwig, but closer friends refer
        to me using my initials: Ash. I live in Lafayette, Colorado and my major
        is declared as ``Associate of Science: Mathematics for Transfer''. My
        Home College is Front Range Community College, mainly in the online
        medium for the last two years with only one in-person class I took in
        2018. I prefer enrolling in online classes because it allows me more
        freedom to continue working my normal full-time hours and get school
        work complete without having to be physically present in a classroom.
        Because of my experience working in IT remoteley before switching to
        the industry I am in currently, online class was not too large an
        adjustment for me. One of my favorite hobbies is where I am currently
        working with various protection dog training schools as an protection
        dog training apprentice and agitator.

        I plan on making time to complete this class whenever I can fit it in,
        which is pretty easy for me to do throughout the day as well as after
        work. I recently purchased a laptop for this specific purpose, so I am
        able to complete tasks throughout my work day. I am an inventory manager
        at a marijuana dispensary in Denver, and even though the cannabis
        retail industry is even more hectic during the essential-business
        designation than ever before I will still have significant time
        available to complete assignments as I have consistent schedule where I
        am out of work by 6:00PM every day. I don't really travel so much with
        the exception of to Atlanta and Los Angeles. I was born in Kansas, then
        lived in St.\ Louis for 2 years, then in Birmingham for 3 years, and
        finally spent most of my childhood until my sophomore year of High
        School in Atlanta. I moved to Colorado in 2013 and when the rest of my
        family left for Los Angeles in 2016 I decided to stay here.
