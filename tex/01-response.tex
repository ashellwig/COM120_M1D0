    I feel it it is very important to have someone's perspective on
      interpersonal communication as behavioral therapy technician. I also can
      understand the difficulty in presenting a comforting appearance when
      attempting to communicate with \textit{anybody} having one of their
      ``bad days''. When you had mentioned that during GG's bad days, she can
      sometimes become more anxious if she can sense your own anxiety or fear
      when face without knowledge of how to handle a certain situation I was
      wondering if you happened to have yet found a good way to remain in a
      ``good light'', so to speak, during difficult interactions.
